# Machine Learning Projects

This repository showcases three projects in machine learning. Each project focuses on different aspects and techniques of predictive modeling, aimed at building skills with ML tools.

## Projects

**1. Project 1: Bank Churn Prediction**

  Description: Predicting whether a customer will continue using their account or close it (i.e., whether churn will occur) based on information about bank customers.  
  Tools and Libraries: Scikit-learn  
  Methods: logistic regression  

**2. Project 2: Forecasting Product Sales Using Time Series Analysis Methods**

  Description: Predicting product sales for 1 month using historical data
  Tools and Libraries: statsmodels, darts
  Methods: XGBoost, Exponential Smoothing, Prophet, ARIMA, AutoARIMA, RNN
      
**3. Project 3: Sentiment Classification of Social Media Texts**

  Description: Creating a model for automatic text classification (positive, neutral, negative).  
  Tools and Libraries: NLTK, Scikit-learn, CountVectorizer.  
  Methods: Text processing, classification techniques (logistic regression, decision trees).
