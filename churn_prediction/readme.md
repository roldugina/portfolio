# Binary Classification for Bank Customer Churn Prediction

Predicting whether a customer will continue using their account or close it (i.e., whether churn will occur) based on information about bank customers.
The project demonstrates the machine learning process from data preprocessing to constructing a predictive pipeline that integrates data preprocessing and model training.

## Project Overview

### Dataset:

Download the dataset from Google Drive:

* train set: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fSdfrwt8B5aQ4H2CIpZMkhNUrz9Ii13i/view?usp=drive_link  
* test set: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DIgalnGEA6xRpQl1st3jAe_ZdqdM7SCF/view?usp=sharing  

### Project Steps

1. Prepare Categorical and Numerical Features to ensure they are suitable for the Machine Learning model.
2. Make a Logistic Regression Classifier.
3. Construct a Predictive Pipeline that integrates the preprocessing steps and the logistic regression classifier
4. Evaluate the quality of the model using appropriate metrics
5. Save the Trained Model.
 
### Technical Aspects

  Library: scikit-learn  
  Algorithms Used: Logistic Regression  
  Output: The model predicts whether the churn will occur
